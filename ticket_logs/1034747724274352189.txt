TehDruid: Hey! think rust server is down
Terpene (Head Admin): Thanks John, it went offline for its daily restart at 6am never came back online been offline roughly 4-5 hours, I am pretty sure itâ€™s because they never got payment from me for some reason, they normally take it automatically. 

Server should be back up now and joinable sorry for the inconvenience!
TehDruid: no worries!
TehDruid: thank you
