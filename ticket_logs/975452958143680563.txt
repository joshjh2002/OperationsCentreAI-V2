Operations Centre AI: Hello <@585495081713139765>, thank you for creating a support ticket! The <@&892427926811865119> will be with you shortly. Please can you describe your issue below?
adam03: I was offline for 5 hours and my smelter station and blacksmith table decayed
JackalTaco (Head Admin): Yeah we had someone else who had a decay issue but it was slightly different. I will look into the decay settings once the server is a bit quieter and see if there's an issue there. In the meanwhile I'd be happy to refund your smelter station and blacksmith station.
adam03: Yes please. I was about to build a taping pen and lost all my resources
Operator MEE6: <@585495081713139765> just advanced to level 2!
JackalTaco (Head Admin): I'll do that right now ðŸ™‚
adam03: Thanks
