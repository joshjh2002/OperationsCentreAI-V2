Thai: I admin my own rust server and had a question for you
Thai: I saw ur post in the rust fb page and had a look at your info screen
Thai: thats welcome UI from david right?
Terpene (Head Admin): That's correct, I am using that plugin
Thai: tell me
Thai: how did you maange to modify your logo into the header? :p
Thai: hahaha
Terpene (Head Admin): David does good work, I was able to try out the vote map extension before it released publicly
Thai: another 10 bucks, he could have included it in the addon imo
Terpene (Head Admin): I agree, but I won't question how he wants to do it
Terpene (Head Admin): So you need to go into data and then CUIdata
Terpene (Head Admin): For WelcomePanel of course
Thai: there is an option to  make the header like yours? or you modify it?
Thai: 
Thai: 
Terpene (Head Admin): So I believe the way it works is upon loading the plugin it ask you which template you want to use
Terpene (Head Admin): I am not sure if you can change templates after choosing one, that would be something to ask David tbh
Terpene (Head Admin): ./wp_template
Thai: oh its just a template, nothing fancy
Terpene (Head Admin): Be careful cause you could mess up what you got now
Terpene (Head Admin): 
Thai: understandable
Thai: ooh
Thai: you choose the first template
Operator MEE6: <@457642480415014922> just advanced to level 1!
Thai: but i did not know you could at your logo that big to the side
Thai: I like the third one
Terpene (Head Admin): You would probably be able to do it with the one you got rn
Terpene (Head Admin): You just need to mess around with the links in CUIdata
Thai: and it does not conflict the code in any way if there would be an update let us say?
Terpene (Head Admin): Nah it shouldn't even David said that if you want to change images that's where you can do it
Terpene (Head Admin): But only for images
Terpene (Head Admin): like for the buttons and stuff
Thai: alright man, i'll have a look into this with my developer
Thai: thanks for your f ast reply
Thai: how old is your server how is going
Terpene (Head Admin): No problem bro, that's what we do here! Just hit 2 months old this force wipe, it's going pretty good I been enjoying it everyone that has stayed to play has good things to say good thing. There is more things I want to make better but I need to pace myself, just a one man team.
Terpene (Head Admin): How is your going?
Thai: Haha, same here, also a one  man operation that cost some money. But I am enjoying it so far. Now working on my website and some promotion to grow the pop
Thai: How come your server is not showing in the list?
Terpene (Head Admin): Hell yeah bro got nothing but love for the other admins, its tough out here for us but keep your head up high and be proud of what you created.
