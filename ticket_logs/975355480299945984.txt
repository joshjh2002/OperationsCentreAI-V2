Operations Centre AI: Hello <@251199653565956097>, thank you for creating a support ticket! The <@&892427926811865119> will be with you shortly. Please can you describe your issue below?
King Ty: Heyo! I'm not sure if much can be done here since I don't know if there's any extra info on the admin side that doesn't show in my event log, but I think I had a wheel of pain decay bug

 I had a lesser wheel of pain right beside my building for a few weeks. There's still another one a few feet away. I replaced one of them with a greater wheel of pain and it decayed. I'm not sure how it decayed since there wasn't any difference in placement, but it had a t2 taskmaster, t4 carpenter and cimmerian berserker on it which are unfortunately lost
King Ty: For visual reference, I'm standing on the exact spot that the wheel was placed & decayed on. If this one decayed, I'm not sure why the other one just up ahead in the screenshot (or the previous, lesser one I had on this exact spot) didn't have this issue
JackalTaco (Head Admin): Hey King Ty, sorry for the late reply, I was working today.
Thanks for all the info you supplied here, it is strange indeed that the greater wheel of pain decayed but not the other one.

It seems that the game has probably counted the decay on that wheel of pain separately than  your base decay for some reason. I can replace the greater wheel of pain for you but just keep an eye on the decay of things from time to time in case this happens again
King Ty: Alright, thanks man
JackalTaco (Head Admin): No problem, just give me a hola when you're online and I'll send it your way ðŸ™‚
King Ty: I'm hopping on now ðŸ™‚
JackalTaco (Head Admin): I gave the greater wheel of pain to Sasherry ðŸ™‚
