LeanaMae: Twice now my home teleport was deleted and my beds disappeared, stranding me across the map. My home is not close to a town
Terpene (Head Admin): I am sorry for the inconvenience, I did inform the Conan Head Admin about your last base being deleted. I unfortunately can't do anything from my end as I wouldn't be able to figure out the issue.  @JackalTaco (Head Admin) will be with you soon to figure out and resolve your issue. Again, I apologize that there's nothing I can do.
LeanaMae: It's ok thank you for the help
JackalTaco (Head Admin): Hey Leana, I'm sorry this has happened to you again but I'll try my hardest to get to the bottom of it.
Could you tell me please, is your base using stage foundations from the Derketo expansion?LeanaMae: The base is fine. The /home  keeps getting deleted and my beds. My base is made up of the normal feats. I didn't use the mods.
JackalTaco (Head Admin): I'll have a look at the logs and see if I see anything unusual in there
JackalTaco (Head Admin): Hey Leana, I had a look through some of the server logs, however, it is like looking for a needle in a haystack as the problem could have happened at any time within the time you were logged off. So I can try and narrow the issue down I'll need some more information from you.
When you die and go to respawn is your bed not there or is it there but just saying that its 'blocked?
What kind of bed is it you were using?
LeanaMae: I didn't die last night I treated home and logged off as soon as I realized it happened again. The bed is  normal luxurious bed. I just wanted it know that it is happening.
JackalTaco (Head Admin): The /home deletion is likely an issue with the Pippi mod, I've posted in their Discord and will try and get to the bottom of that.
As for your bed, is it completely disappearing or is it still there but you just can't spawn on it?
LeanaMae: It's there but can't spawn to it. I should have replaced it. I didn't think if it. Later when I get on
JackalTaco (Head Admin): Is it the same bed as last time when you had this issue or did you place it again after that time?
LeanaMae: Same one. I didn't think to replace it until jow
Operator MEE6: <@462780242768035850> just advanced to level 2!
JackalTaco (Head Admin): Alright, thanks for letting me know! I'll await a response from the mod creator for the /home bug thing and I'll test out the current bed you are using in case it is an issue with the bed. I'll let you know what I find out and if I resolve the issue. In the meanwhile try to change to a different bed and see if that has the same issue ðŸ™‚
JackalTaco (Head Admin): Hey Leana, sorry I haven't got back to you until now, I've been fixing a lot of server issues to make sure the server runs smooth as possible.
I have not yet got a response from the mod dev regarding the /home deleting bug so at the moment try to avoid using this feature and just use regular bed spawns until I get to the bottom of it. Make sure your bed is not blocked by anything as this can affect your spawn ability and if this does not work try using a different bed.
LeanaMae: I am sorry I havent gotten back to you, I had something going on. I am going to change the  bed. Thank you for your hard work on this
JackalTaco (Head Admin): No worries at all, happy to help ðŸ™‚
