ᵇˡᵃᶻⁱⁿᵍ ฅ ̳͒•ˑ̫• ̳͒ฅ ɴʏᴀ~: not entirely sure if this is the correct time to be mentioning it, but a usually trusted user and friend of most admins Blur#0552 has been sending links to a discord server in which steals login information/hacks accounts ect, and is going dming people as part of the spreading of hacked accounts. just thought id bring this to attention in case some people weren't aware / needed to be aware of this
